<h2><span class="pink">About</span></h2>
<div>
<p>Hello, my name is Isabella Carmona and this is my art and computer science portfolio. 
I create digital and traditional art. I have been a self-taught artist 
for about three years. I started off by playing around on Adobe Photoshop
 and Illustrator and creating digital illustrations. I now use Procreate 
 as my main drawing application. On the computer science side, I have experience balancing
multiple projects in Python, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>
 <p>
	I am currently attending St. Ambrose University, where I am majoring
	in Graphic Design and Computer Science. Thanks to my schooling, I have 
	been able to explore traditional art and get a more formal education 
	on the subject itself, including its history. I decided to pick 
	computer science as my second major because I genuinely enjoy the problem-solving
aspect and it excites me to learn about all of the amazing things I can do
with it. My ultimate goal is to bring a creative thought-process into the computer
science world in order to make great innovations.

<p>
An artist that inspires me greatly is <span class="pink">Lisa Strausfeld</span> (above), who is a graphic designer and
information architect. I find her particularly interesting because she studied
art history and computer science while she attended college. This is very similar to
what I am studying and I strive to be as innovative as her with her information art as
it is crucial to display the right message to viewers in the art and business world.

<div>
<p>Another artist that left an impression on me when I did a research paper on his work was
<span class="pink">Takenobu Igarashi</span> (above). This man is a designer and has transcended the norms
of isometric typography. He was active during the dawn of the digital
age and was able to create amazing three-dimensional typography without
using computer software. He even preferred to make his types analogously
because he said that the software yielded rather boring results. He makes
me want to explore new mediums and take risks because after all these years, his
designs continue to be groundbreaking.</p>

<div>
<p>An artist that inspires me in my personal art is <span class="pink">Kim Jung Gi</span> (above). He is a cartoonist
and animator that has awesome sketchbooks. I would love to buy
one of them one day. He has the ability to just sit down and draw 
whatever comes to his mind without looking at a reference. This is because
he has put in so many hours of looking at objects and transferring them
to paper that he can now design scenes in his mind. His mind just has
references burned into it! My goal is to reach this point one day.</p>
