<h2><span>My Background</span></h2>
<div>
<p>Computer Science is my other major at St. Ambrose University. I first 
found out about computer science through a parent from the daycare I used 
to work at. She seemed very happy and successful in her job and I asked 
her what she majored in when she was in college. She told me, "computer 
science." This planted the seed in my mind, but I still did not really 
understand what the subject was, since I was not very technologically
inclined. Around this time, I had been developing my love for art and I did not
really think too much about computer science for the next couple of years. </p>

<p>In the spring of 2021, I finally decided to buckle down and explore my college 
options. I decided on graphic design and once I started looking at the
required classes and different job requirements, I noticed that computer science
kept popping up. I made the decision that it 
would be extremely beneficial for me to have coding skills. I took an online
Udemy course for Python in August so I could dip my toes in the water 
before I started school. I ended up loving it!
Since I had already learned to pay close attention to detail through my
art, programming has come relatively easy to me. Even though 
technology used to seem daunting to me, I feel that I have a unique way of 
finding solutions because of my artistic background.</p>

<p>Now that I am in school, I truly love programming. The homework that is 
assigned to me is very satisfying and I find myself cheering for joy after
debugging code that had me wracking my brain for an hour. Right now, I am
taking a Foundations of Computer Science course, which is where I am 
learning the skills to make the website you are looking at right now!
I enjoy this front-end coding class and I have been having a lot of 
fun with the CSS rules. I like using HTML and JavaScript because I can see 
the results of my coding come to life in color on a website.
My Programming I class, which is Python-based, is different in some ways, since it's
more back-end coding. I actually think it is just as much
fun, though, because I get to solve a lot of logical problems. I am learning more about
this type of math in my Discrete Structures course and it definitely feels a lot more 
applicable to real life than high school math.

<h2><span>Interactive Programs I Created In Python</span></h2>

<h4>"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock"</h4>
<div>
<p>This program shows a menu with 5 options. The user then chooses
who they want to play as and the computer's choice is randomly generated.
The program uses many if/elif/else statements and returns unique strings,
depending on the user and computer choices.</p>

<br>
<h4>"Flipping Coins"</h4>
<div>
<p>The program shows a menu for the user
to choose from. There are options that complete relatively simple tasks, 
such as flipping a coin, using a random integer generator, and returning
"Heads" or "Tails." It can also complete more complicated tasks, such as
using nested for loops and if/else statements to find the likelihood of
getting four "Heads" in a row.</p>
</div>

<img style="border:2px solid #fafafa" src="flipCoin5.png" alt="Flip Coin Option 5" height="394" width="700">
<br>
<h4>"Pixel Averaging"</h4>
<div>
<p>This program averages pixels from PPM files and converts a noisy image 
into a significantly higher resolution one. This is done using nested for loops. 
I really loved creating this program and I was impatient during the whole 
process because I could not wait to see the end results! I would love to 
have a job doing this for photographers. Click on the buttons below to see 
the "before" images turn into the "after" images.

<h4>"Sudoku Solver"</h4>
<div>
<p>This program solves simple sudoku puzzles by reading in a text file
and implements nested sets and while loops in its algorithm. The video below shows an example
of the program solving a simple puzzle and then failing to solve a 
slightly more difficult one.

<br><br>
<h4>"Recursive Art"</h4>
<div>
<p>
This program involved using a recursive approach to the algorithm. It
creates random computer-generated colored squares that look like Piet
Mondrian's abstract art. This was also definitely my favorite program
that I have written so far because I got to be creative for the second
part of it (right image). I tweaked it so that some of the squares turned black or 
a different color, depending on their location. This resulted in a 
Tetris-like pattern.
