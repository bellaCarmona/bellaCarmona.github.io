<h2><span>My Background</span></h2>
<div>
<p>	
Welcome to my digital art page! I started making digital art in 2019. I was working another job at the time and I started to notice people on the Internet making art and 
I yearned to have that type creative passion. So, I started creating art in my free time. I particularly liked the anime style of art and so I started 
creating my own illustrations based off of popular media. I used Adobe Photoshop for about 2 years and made a conscious effort to draw almost 
every day. I eventually switched to the Procreate application for illustration on iPad. My first few drawings are obviously a bit embarrassing, since 
I am still a relatively new artist. But, through loads of repetition and patience, I have reached the place I am at today. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, digital art has been life changing for me. During the past year, I have been able to connect with other digital artists who make art for
their career. After speaking with them and hearing their experiences, they are what really motivated me to start going to college. I have decided
that I wanted to get a formal education on it in order to make my art even more marketable. I would also like to learn the ins and outs of the art 
industry and figure out my place in the art world!

 Below are some of my pieces from the year 2021.

<div>
<p> In my 2-D Design class,
I designed a gig poster for a made-up band named “Revenge on Ithaca.” The band received this name because the poster depicts 
Circe, a minor goddess from ancient Greek mythology. 
She was exiled to the island of Aeaea after turning another goddess into a sea monster. She became very attuned to the nature 
of her island and in turn honed her potent magical powers. Visitors would wash up on her shore at times, but often they were 
brute men that she turned into pigs when they would make forceful advances on her. One of the men that came to her island was 
Odysseus from the island of Ithaca and they ended up becoming lovers. He eventually had to leave her to return to his wife on 
Ithaca and much drama ensued after this due to the fact that Circe was pregnant with his child. Therefore, this is 
where the poster received its name, as Circe felt, understandably, heartbroken from the incident. She is a very powerful 
feminine figure and I attempted to portray this sentiment in the poster using the principles of shape, color, and line. This 
piece was very fun for me to make, especially since I love her story. My inspiration for the art style was Aubrey Beardsley, 
who also used contour lines and black, white, and sometimes red in his pieces. I am very happy and proud of how it came out and 
it is even hanging on my bedroom wall right now!

I would say the piece I am most proud of is "Medusa's Daughter". It took me about 3 weeks to finish and it was the first time that 
I added intricate details to a background on one of my works. I am absolutely in love with the color scheme I chose also, as I believe 
the popping colors add to the magical effect of it. I am currently working on "Thinking About You", and I hope to add a big city apartment type
background to it with just as much detail. I am excited for this piece since I have recently been trying to go for a more realistic style. Here is a
work-in-progress picture of it below!

The video below shows my drawing of the fictional Minotaur from ancient Greek mythology, which is something that I am very interested in! I read a
lot about this subject and I have a lot of fun transferring the images I see in my mind onto a visual plane. This video also shows what it looks 
like to draw on an iPad, using my Apple pencil. You can hear the sound the pencil makes as I draw on my matte screen protector. I chose this protector 
for the satisfying sound and for the fact that it allows my hand to slide across the screen easier while drawing.
