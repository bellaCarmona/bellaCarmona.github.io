<h2><span>My Progress</span></h2>
<div>
<p>I have been in school for a few months now. I am really happy with
all that I have learned so far in such a short amount of time! It has actually been extremely fun trying
 out different materials that I never would have thought of using before,
like aluminum. I was honestly kind of scared when I first started just
because I do not have any experience with traditional art. Fortunately
though, my teachers have been very supportive and my months of digital drawing have translated
into confidence with drawing on paper. I am not quite perfect at it yet and
I still have a lot to learn, but I know that will just come with more practice.

<h2><span>Charcoal Drawing</span></h2>

<p>This audio file is the sound of me sketching with charcoal. You 
can hear the different types of noises I made depending on how I moved my 
pencil. I made hatching motions, circular motions, and shading motions. I 
think it's a very satisfying to listen to. Sometimes while I'm drawing, I 
do not listen to music so I can relax and only hear these calming 
sounds.</p>

<video id="video1" src="charcoalVideo.mp4"

<div>
<p>The video file above is of me showing the camera what my hands
look like after I have been sketching for a long time. When I draw with 
charcoal, my hands turn very black. When I use graphite, they turn a
more silvery color, but get just as dirty. This is because the materials
become powdery (especially the charcoal) while I am using them. This can
be to my advantage, though, when I want to make shapes look softer or 
for shading. If I use a black glove with the fingertips cut off, it tends
to lead to less of this mess.</p>

<h2><span>Exhibition Experience</span></h2>
<div>
<p>
In my AH-355 History of Graphic Design class, I had the opportunity to display
my art work in Morrissey Gallery and St. Ambrose University. The project was in
support of the Re/Building Community annual theme that the school currently has. 
I chose a historical inspiration and implemented it in a work that represents 
"where I come from." My inspiration was Simon de Colines from the Renaissance
period and his beautifully detailed book covers. This project was a bit out of 
my comfort zone because I have not really ever made art that is introspective 
in nature. I ended up embracing it, though, and I would even like to redo it 
with a bit more contrast of black and white the next time.

<h2><span>Current Project</span></h2>
<div>
<p>
I am currently working on a series of drawings related to the word "comb".
This project started out as a challenge for me because it did not have a set 
of rules to constrain the works, like still-life might do. Our teacher instead
encouraged us to think out-of-the-box and draw anything, in any style, that 
relates to the word we chose. Once I got started, I began to have fun with the
project and I realized that my pieces do not have to represent what
most people imagine the word "comb" to be. This truly freed my imagination
and below is what I have come up with so far.
